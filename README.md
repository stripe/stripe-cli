The Stripe CLI helps you build, test, and manage your Stripe integration right from the terminal.

**With the CLI, you can:**

- Securely test webhooks without relying on 3rd party software
- Trigger webhook events or resend events for easy testing
- Tail your API request logs in real-time
- Create, retrieve, update, or delete API objects.
