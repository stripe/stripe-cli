[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stripe/stripe-cli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stripe/stripe-cli)

The Stripe CLI helps you build, test, and manage your Stripe integration right from the terminal.

**With the CLI, you can:**

- Securely test webhooks without relying on 3rd party software
- Trigger webhook events or resend events for easy testing
- Tail your API request logs in real-time
- Create, retrieve, update, or delete API objects.

## Installation

Stripe CLI is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux for distros like Ubuntu, Debian, RedHat and CentOS.

### macOS

Stripe CLI is available on macOS via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
```

### Linux

Refer to the [installation instructions](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#install) for available Linux installation options.

### Windows

Stripe CLI is available on Windows via the [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) package manager:

```sh
scoop bucket add stripe https://github.com/stripe/scoop-stripe-cli.git
scoop install stripe
```

### Docker

The CLI is also available as a Docker image: [`stripe/stripe-cli`](https://hub.docker.com/r/stripe/stripe-cli).

```sh
docker run --rm -it stripe/stripe-cli version
stripe version x.y.z (beta)
```

**Password Store Setup with Docker**

While test mode doesnâ€™t require password store, you will need to set it up if you wish to perform live mode requests.

> You can also make live mode requests on a per command basis by attaching the `--api-key` flag.

1. Create `entrypoint.sh`

```sh
#!/bin/sh
if ! [ -f ~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg ] ; then
  chmod 700 ~/.gnupg/
  gpg --quick-generate-key stripe-live # This will generate a gpg key called "stripe-live"
fi
if ! [ -f ~/.password-store/.gpg-id ] ; then
  pass init stripe-live # This will initialize a password store record named "stripe-live", using the gpg key above
  pass insert stripe-live # This will insert value for the password store "stripe-live", which we will put Stripe Live Secret Key in
fi

string="$@"
liveflag="--live"

if [ -z "${string##*$liveflag*}" ] ;then
  OPTS="--api-key $(pass show stripe-live)" # This will use the content of the password store "stripe-live" which was inserted in line 8
fi

#pass insert stripe-live
/bin/stripe  $@ $OPTS
```

2. Create a docker file `Dockerfile-cli`

```sh
FROM  stripe/stripe-cli:vx.x.x
RUN  apk  add  pass  gpg-agent
COPY  ./entrypoint.sh  /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT  [ "/entrypoint.sh" ]
```

3. Build the docker image

```sh
docker build -t stripe-cli -f Dockerfile-cli .
```

4. Run the docker image with password volumes, replacing `$command` with the appropraite Stripe CLI command (i.e `customers list`)

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v stripe-config://root/.config/stripe/ -v stripe-gpg://root/.gnupg/ -v stripe-pass://root/.password-store/ stripe-cli $command
``` 

> For live mode requests append `--live` after `$command`.

### Without package managers

Instructions are also available for installing and using the CLI [without a package manager](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/wiki/Installing-and-updating#without-a-package-manager).

## Usage

Installing the CLI provides access to the `stripe` command.

```sh-session
stripe [command]

# Run `--help` for detailed information about CLI commands
stripe [command] help
```
