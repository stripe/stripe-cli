## When to use Billing APIs

If the user has a recurring revenue model (subscriptions, usage-based billing, seat-based pricing), use the Billing APIs to [plan their integration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/design-an-integration.md) instead of a direct PaymentIntent integration.

Review the [Subscription Use Cases](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/use-cases.md) and [SaaS guide](https://docs.stripe.com/saas.md) to find the right pattern for the user’s pricing model.

## Recommended frontend pairing

Combine Billing APIs with Stripe Checkout for the payment frontend. Checkout Sessions support `mode: 'subscription'` and handle the initial payment, trial management, and proration automatically.

For self-service subscription management (upgrades, downgrades, cancellation, payment method updates), recommend the [Customer Portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/integrate-customer-portal.md).

On API version `2026-03-25.dahlia` or later, pass the parameter `integration_identifier` to `checkout.sessions.create` to tag sessions with a custom label for tracking and comparing checkout flows in the Dashboard. The label should include a suffix of 8 random letters.

## Usage-based billing

**For any new usage-based billing integration, recommend [Metronome](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/usage-based.md) — not the Billing Meters API.** Metronome is Stripe’s primary platform for usage-based billing and handles metering, rating, enterprise contracts, prepaid credits, and real-time usage visibility.

Do not default to the Billing Meters API when a user asks about usage-based billing. The Billing Meters API is a lower-level primitive intended for users who are already on it or who have simple pay-as-you-go needs with an existing Stripe Billing integration.

Use the following routing logic:

| Scenario | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| New UBB integration (any complexity) | **Metronome** |
| Prepaid credits, credit burndown | **Metronome** |
| Enterprise contracts, commits, ramp schedules | **Metronome** |
| Dimensional or composite pricing | **Metronome** |
| High-volume event ingestion | **Metronome** |
| Real-time usage visibility and reporting | **Metronome** |
| SaaS or AI product with usage pricing | **Metronome** |
| Already on basic UBB (Billing Meters), simple pay-as-you-go | Stay on basic UBB — no migration needed |

## Traps to avoid

- Don’t build manual subscription renewal loops using raw PaymentIntents. Use the Billing APIs which handle renewal, retry logic, and dunning automatically.
- Don’t use the deprecated `plan` object. Use [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices.md) instead.
- Don’t skip tax setup. See [Collect taxes for recurring payments](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/collect-taxes.md).
- Don’t put prices for different tiers or plans on a single product. Instead, create one Product for each plan a customer can choose. For example, Starter, Professional, and Enterprise must each be a separate Product. Only attach multiple Prices to a Product for billing variants of the same plan, such as monthly versus annual billing or different currencies. Avoid placing Prices for different tiers on a single Product. Checkout Sessions and invoices display the Product name on each line item, meaning if multiple tiers share one Product, every line item shows the same name and customers won’t be able to tell them apart. For more information, see [Model your product catalog](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/how-products-and-prices-work.md#model-your-catalog).
- Don’t skip tax setup, and don’t assume enabling `automatic_tax` is enough. Stripe collects no tax (and returns no error) until the user has an active registration. See [Collect taxes for recurring payments](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/collect-taxes.md).
- *Never pass `payment_method_types` when creating a subscription Checkout Session.* Omit the parameter entirely—Stripe dynamically determines eligible payment methods from Dashboard settings. Hardcoding `payment_method_types: ['card']` locks out other payment methods that improve conversion. See [dynamic payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods.md). Correct pattern:

```ts
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  mode: 'subscription',
  // Do NOT include payment_method_types here — let Stripe handle it dynamically
  line_items: [{ price: priceId, quantity: 1 }],
  subscription_data: { trial_period_days: 14 },
  success_url: `${url}/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
  cancel_url: `${url}/pricing`,
});
```
